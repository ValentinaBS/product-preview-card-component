## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [Picture tag resource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the use of the picture tag. I didn't know it was possible to change an image depending on the size of the page, using only HTML and CSS.

- [Style with uppercase instead of writing it](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/why-you-shouldnt-write-your-content-in-uppercase-instead-use-css-b03ac2c65b99) - I had my doubts about the P E R F U M E text of the card, since that looks tricky for accesibility. I knew that I had to do the letter spacing in CSS, but I wasn't so sure about the uppercase. That's why this article was very helpful!
